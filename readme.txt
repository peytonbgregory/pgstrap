This is a stripped down bootstrap based Wordpress theme.

== Description ==

This is a barebones theme that I use as a framework to build completely customized Wordpress websites. This theme is meant to be used by web developers, not end users. User-friendly elements are to be added as needed. If anyone actually reads this I'll be surprised. Buy me a beer. Paypal - peyton@peytongrergory.com

== Installation ==

If you don't know how to install a Wordpress theme this is not the theme for you.
